| Contract     | A style of designing software in which functions specify the pre-conditions that must be true in order for them to run and the post-conditions they guarantee will be true when they return. A function can then be replaced by one with weaker pre-conditions (i.e., it accepts a wider set of input) and/or stronger post-conditions (i.e., it produces a smaller range of output) without breaking anything else.       |
| Derive   | In object-oriented programming, a class that is a direct or indirect extension of a base class. See also: child class.|
